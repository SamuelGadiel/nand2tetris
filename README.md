> Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

The base of this project are both a course in Coursera and a book.

[Coursera - Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

[Book - The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686)

The course is divided in 12 weeks and a final project, as follows

## Hack Hardware Plataform
- [Boolean Logic](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week1) - Elementary logic gates like Not, And, Or, Mux, etc.
- [Boolean Arithmetic](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week2) - Combinational Chips, the ALU.
- [Sequential Logic](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week3) - Sequential Chips, Memory.
- [Machine Language](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week4) - Assembly programming.
- [Computer Architecture](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week5) - CPU + Memory = Computer.

## Software hierarchy
- [Assembler](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week6) - Hack Assembler in **Python**.
- Virtual Machine translator - Translate VM language into Hack assembly language in PHP.
  - [Virtual Machine I - Stack arithmetic](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week7)
  - [Virtual machine II - Program control](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week8)
- [High-Level Language](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week9) - Introducing Jack programming language and coding Tetris.
- Jack Compiler - Jack Compiler in **Python**.
  - [Compiler I - Syntax analysis](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week10)
  - [Compiler II - Code generation](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week11)
- [Operating System](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Week12) - Jack Operating System or Standard library.

## Final Project
A [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/nand2tetris/tree/master/Jogo%20da%20Velha) game made with the Jack language

The course idea is to understand how a computer works, from the NAND logic gate to a high-level code.
